JSON as first class data type for Rust. That includes,

* [ ] Serialisation from Rust native type to JSON text.
* [ ] Deserialisation from JSON text to Rust native type.
* [ ] Common arithmetic and logic operations.
* [ ] Streaming JSON parser.

Why yet another json crate ?

* This crate makes several tradeoffs that are tuned for bigdata.
* JSON as first class data implementing several arithmetic and
  logical operations.
* Streaming JSON parser is implemented and optimised separately.
